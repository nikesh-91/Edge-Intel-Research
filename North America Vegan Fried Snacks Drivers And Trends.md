As consumers shift towards plant-based diets, they seek healthier snack alternatives that align with their ethical values. The rise in veganism, driven by concerns over animal welfare, environmental impact, and health, encourages manufacturers to innovate and provide a variety of fried snacks that cater to this demand. Additionally, advancements in food technology enable better-tasting, nutrient-rich, and oil-optimized products, further propelling market growth.</p><p>Another significant trend is the expansion of vegan fried snack options in retail and foodservice channels.
